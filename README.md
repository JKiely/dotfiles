<h1> Dotfiles </h1>

A repository of my custom dotfiles. They can be installed on a new machine by cloning the repo into the home directory and running the install script, which will move any existing dotfiles into an 'old dotfiles' directory and create symbolic links to the files in this folder.


<h4> How to use: </h4>

```bash
git clone git@github.com:JKiely/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
./install.sh
```
